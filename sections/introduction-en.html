<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
Homebrewing and craft beer production generate vast amounts of recipe data across forums, 
applications, and brewing software. However, this knowledge remains fragmented and difficult to 
query semantically. The Beer Recipe Ontology addresses this gap by providing a formal, 
machine-readable representation of brewing knowledge.
</p>

<h3>Scope and Coverage</h3>
<p>The ontology covers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Detailed modeling of malts, hops (with alpha acids), yeasts (fermentation characteristics), cereals, and water profiles</li>
    <li><strong>Recipes</strong>: Complete recipe specifications with measurements, brewing parameters (OG, FG, ABV, IBU, EBC)</li>
    <li><strong>Brewing Process</strong>: Sequential steps (mashing, boiling, fermentation, conditioning) with time and temperature parameters</li>
    <li><strong>Beer Styles</strong>: BJCP-inspired style classifications with acceptable parameter ranges</li>
    <li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Brewing equipment requirements with transitive dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Property Chain Axioms</strong>: Automatic inference of beer style from recipe (hasBeerStyle inferred from isProducedBy ∘ hasStyle)</li>
    <li><strong>Defined Classes</strong>: SessionBeer, StrongBeer, and BeginnerRecipe with automatic classification based on ABV and difficulty</li>
    <li><strong>Cardinality Constraints</strong>: Recipes must have at least 1 malt, 1 hop, 1 cereal, 1 water, and exactly 1 yeast</li>
    <li><strong>Symmetric Properties</strong>: Ingredient substitution and recipe similarity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Target Users</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Homebrewers seeking recipe recommendations</li>
    <li>Brewing software developers building semantic search features</li>
    <li>Researchers studying beer styles and ingredient interactions</li>
    <li>Semantic web practitioners interested in food/beverage ontologies</li>
</ul>
