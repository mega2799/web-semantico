<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">

The Beer Recipe Ontology is a comprehensive semantic model designed to represent the domain of beer brewing recipes using OWL 2 and linked data principles. This ontology captures the complex relationships between brewing ingredients (malts, hops, yeasts, cereals, water), brewing processes, equipment requirements, and beer styles. The ontology enables recipe discovery through semantic queries, ingredient substitution based on flavor profiles, automated beer style classification using parameter ranges (ABV, IBU, EBC), and detailed process modeling with sequential brewing steps. It integrates external vocabularies including the hops ontology, malt ontology, and FOODON to leverage existing brewing knowledge and ensure semantic interoperability across brewing data sources. The ontology follows W3C best practices and includes comprehensive annotations, examples, and cardinality constraints to ensure data quality.
